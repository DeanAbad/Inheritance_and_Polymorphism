# Inheritance and Polymorphism
A repository of demonstrations of inheritance and polymorphism.

## Usage
1. Simply enter one of the folders which indicates the type of inheritance or polymorphism.
2. Download either the source code or application, or both to test later on the inderitance or polymorphism in action.

## Notes
- The examples of different inheritances are under the 'Types' directory.
- The examples of virtual functions and overloaded functions are under the 'Polymorphism' directory.
- The polymorphism examples are simple for now and does not possess that much of interactive content, and thus
  its demonstration can only be done with looking into the source code and compiling it.
- The Multilevel/Game_Player_Class_Example/main.cpp is incomplete in terms of possible functionalities
  its classes' members i.e. they were not fully used, however, the multilevel inheritance is still applied.
  I am not certain of the time when it will be completed (e.g. to function fully like a mock game), but
  for now at least it serves its purpose.
