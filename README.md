# Inheritance
A repository of demonstrations of inheritance and polymorphism.

## Usage
1. Simply enter one of the folders which indicates the type of inheritance.
2. Download either the source code or application, or both to test later on the inderitance in action.

## Note
- The examples of different inheritances are now under the 'Types' directory.
- The Multilevel/Game_Player_Class_Example/main.cpp is incomplete in terms of possible functionalities
  its classes' members i.e. they were not fully used, however, the multilevel inheritance is still applied.
  I am not certain of the time when it will be completed (e.g. to function fully like a mock game), but
  for now at least it serves its purpose.
